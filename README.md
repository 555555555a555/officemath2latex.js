# officemath2latex.js

This program defines a function named `processMathNode` that converts mathematical
expressions in OfficeMath format (DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Math) to LaTeX code.
It takes an XML element as input and returns the corresponding LaTeX representation.
The input mathXml element must be `m:oMath` node.

It handles all formulas included as samples in MS Word equations and any mathematical 
elements you can create using the Word equation toolbar. This should be sufficient for 
most users. However, we understand that some users might require advanced functionalities 
for complex equations.
